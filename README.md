<!-- Project Title -->
# Web Based Online Exams
## Project Summary:
<!-- A little brief about what the project is about. It should be like a small summary format informing about the main purpose of the project. -->
The intention is to make online exam available using PHP/MySQL Apache web server. The scripts are commented as necessary, but feel free to update the same. One can install the scripts, and configure the same appropriately, after which, it is possible to create, populate, and deliver the exams over the Internet. The user just needs to login to take the exam(s)

 ### Background 
<!--- This section is for letting the reader know why you created this project, the reason behind pursuing such a project, and why you have decided to do it.
-->
It is the intention of the founding members to make free online exam scripts available to the public without any hassles and one can have an exam delivery platform of one's own using LAMP environment.

### Build Status

<!--  This basically explains the current build status of the project. If there is a bug /error which needs addressing. This is done so for two different reasons The user understands that this is an issue and does not spend more time figuring if it was a mistake on their part.A developer who is familiar with the issue can suggest some solutions directly without going through the whole code. -->

The package is fully functional according to the current version. However, there is huge scope for improvement and additional contribution is welcome! 

### Code Style
<!-- This lets the users know that you have used a particular code style and helps them when contributing to your project so that the whole project code style stays the same. Some common code styles: standard, xo, etc. -->

The entire project uses html, Javascript, PHP, Perl, MySQL, and xml. Therefore, contributers need to be familiar with these scripting languages to write any code. 

### Screenshots
<!-- As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.
-->
#### Given below are a few screenshots as it is now:

### Tech/Framework used
<!-- This is used to help the reader understand which tech or frameworks have been used to do the project. It helps the reader understand which all tech stack he has to be familiar with to understand the whole project. -->

The code is entirely developed using notepad (text editor) and no content development software is used. Basically, one just needs a text editor for code changes or development. A picture editor would be required for editing images. Note that the content depends on the question base and the type of questions. It has nothing to do with the exam software itself.

### Features
<!-- This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically this is where you try to make your project stand out from the rest. -->

- Simple interface which is intuitive to the user
- Very widely used LAMP environment, where one need not buy any software for making changes or improving the features.
- Learn and exam modes so that users can change between these modes depending on the need
- Scope for improvement
-- there is scope for improving the statistics reporting.

### Code Examples

### Installation
<!-- If your project needs installation of certain software or configurations to the system. Do mention it in this section as it helps a lot for the reader to use your project. The steps mentioned should be precise and explanatory.  If possible, you can add links that can help them better understand how to configure/install the necessary files or softwares. -->


### API reference
<! -- If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented. -->

### Tests
<!-- This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples -->

### How to Use?
<!-- As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it. -->
