<p CLASS="indent10">The navigation menu above works by using the 
<span CLASS="funcname">onChange</span> function of the 
<span CLASS="varname">SELECT</span> object to tell the window to load a new
document. The URLs of the documents to jump to are given by the 
<span CLASS="varname">VALUE</span> of the various 

<span CLASS="varname">OPTION</span> tags contained in the 
<span CLASS="varname">SELECT</span>.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">This kind of navigation tool has the advantage that it takes up less
space than a conventional menu made of text or image links, or an image
map. Unfortunately, it also has some disadvantages.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">One problem is that the navigation menu will take on the
appearance of standard menus on whatever platform your visitors are
using, which is likely to clash with whatever look
and feel you have chosen for your pages on at least some platforms.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">A more serious disadvantage is that this technique depends on
JavaScript. As such, if you use it as the only method of navigation on
your site, you will close your pages to users who have disabled
JavaScript on their browser, as well as those who don't have
JavaScript-capable browsers. As more and more sites use JavaScript to
assault their visitors with pop-up dialogs, scrolling tickers, extra
windows, layers and other assorted irritations, more and more Web users
are likely to disable JavaScript so it is unwise to rely on it as the
only way for people to get around your site.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">A third disadvantage is that embedding your links in a menu in this
way will also stop Web-indexing robots dead in their
tracks (which may or may not be a good thing, depending on your
point of view).</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">It would be possible, with a little effort, to make this system work
for clients who don't have or use JavaScript. To do this, you will need
to do three things.</p>
<ol CLASS="indent10">

	<li>Write a CGI script that reads a URL passed to it as the value of
		the form variable <span CLASS="varname">LinkMenu</span> (if
		you follow the form structure above), converts the URL to an
		absolute URL if necessary (using the 
		<span CLASS="varname">HTTP_REFERER</span> environment variable
		as the base when translating the relative URL to an absolute
		one), then prints the string 'Location:' followed by the 
		converted URL and two line-feeds.</li>
	<li>Set the <span CLASS="varname">ACTION</span> attribute of the
		form above to point to your CGI script, and set the
		<span CLASS="varname">METHOD</span> attribute to
		<span CLASS="varname">GET</span> (or to <span CLASS="varname">POST</span>,
		according to taste).</li>

	<li>Add a submit button to the form, hidden from JavaScript users
		within a <span CLASS="varname">&lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;</span> container.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="indent10">Non-JavaScript users could then choose an item from the menu and click the
submit button to fire up the CGI script. The CGI script will read the location,
and issue a redirect which will send your browser to the desired place.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">This is a very poor solution, for several reasons. First,
the user has to do more work: they have to click on the menu, drag to
the item they want, then move to the submit button and click that. From the
user interface point of view, this is distinctly unattractive. Compare
this with the simplicity of clicking once on an image or a piece of
text. Second, the browser has to do more work. It has to send the
request to the server, wait for the response, and then send another
request to actually get the page. Third, the server has to do more work,
because each time the user wants to go to another page, it has to run a
script (which means that it typically has to launch Perl or a shell,
which can take several seconds and significant CPU and memory resources).
In short, this technique is slow, ugly and horribly inefficient and there's
no real justification for using it.</p>
<p CLASS="indent10">The JavaScript navigation menu itself might possibly make sense if you can
guarantee that all your users will be using JavaScript-capable and -enabled
browsers. It might be of use in a 'JavaScript-only' version of your site
(although the idea of maintaining two parallel document trees, one for
users with JavaScript and another for those without, is not attractive). It
could also be useful on an intranet where you may be able to guarantee that
users are using a particular browser. In the context of the wider Web, it's
little more than a curiosity and probably best left alone.</p>
